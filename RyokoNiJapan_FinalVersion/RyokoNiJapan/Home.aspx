                           Walking into an oil painting? The fragrant wisteria tunnel, the most stunning 
                           display at the Kawachi Fuji Garden, makes it possible. With flowering vines 
                           overhead, the walkway is said to inspire a zen-like calm in visitors. The garden 
                           displays about 150 wisteria plants of 20 different species. It hosts the annual 
                           Wisteria Festival at the end of April, when the flowers are in full bloom.</div></div>

                            one to five hours long, varying in difficulty.

                            Gokayama is one of the greatest towns for architecture buffs in the world. The 
                            oldest traditional gassho style house in Ainokura is said to be about 400 years 
                            old. Part of the UNESCO-designated area of Gokyama, the village preserves an 
                            architectural design that dates back hundreds of years. The steep triangular 
                            thatched roofs were built without the use of nails and are designed to prevent 
                            snow buildup. <br />

                            about 500 years. Using only pure natural water from mountain valleys, Ini 
                            Tanada&#39;s rice is particularly favored for its rich fragrance and taste. The town 
                            regularly holds a rice planting event on its terraces to pass on traditional 
                            farming methods.<br /><br />

                            of the Sotomo Arch were holes on rock carved by the rough waves of the Sea of 
                            Japan. With some careful maneuvering, it&#39;s possible to climb into the Little 
                            Gate. An excursion ship, which departs from the Wakasa Fishermen&#39;s Wharf, offers 
                            rides to view the rock formation. <br /><br />
